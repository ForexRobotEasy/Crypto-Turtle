# Crypto Turtle

Crypto Turtle is a trading expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor follows the Turtle Trader rules to identify potential trading opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. It uses the MetaTrader 4 platform and the MQL4 programming language.

## How it Works

The Crypto Turtle expert advisor uses two main strategies to identify potential trading opportunities: trailing stop and breakout. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. Include necessary libraries: The expert advisor includes the necessary libraries for trading and position information.

2. Define constants: The expert advisor defines two constants, SYMBOL and ENTRY_FACTOR. SYMBOL represents the cryptocurrency symbol to trade, and ENTRY_FACTOR represents the entry factor for the Turtle Trader rules.

3. Define global variables: The expert advisor defines two global variables, trade and entryPrice. trade is an object of the CTrade class used for executing trades, and entryPrice represents the entry price for the current position.

4. Initialize the expert advisor: The OnInit() function sets the symbol for trading.

5. Start the expert advisor: The OnTick() function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if there is an open position using the PositionSelect() function.

6. If there is an open position, it calculates the trailing stop level based on the current position's profit. If the position is profitable enough, it sets the trailing stop level using the PositionSetTrailingStop() function.

7. If there is no open position, it calculates the highest high and lowest low of the last 20 bars using the Highest() and Lowest() functions. Then, it checks if the current price is higher than the highest high or lower than the lowest low.

8. If the current price is higher than the highest high, it calculates the entry price for a long position using the Bid price and the ENTRY_FACTOR. It then opens a new long position using the Buy() function.

9. If the current price is lower than the lowest low, it calculates the entry price for a short position using the Ask price and the ENTRY_FACTOR. It then opens a new short position using the Sell() function.

10. Stop the expert advisor: The OnDeinit() function is called when the expert advisor is stopped. It closes any open positions using the PositionCloseAll() function.
